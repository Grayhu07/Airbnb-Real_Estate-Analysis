# Airbnb-Real_Estate-Analysis

Here I am scraping data from Real Estate and comparing it with Airbnb Data!

This project will compare listing I obtained from Airbnb open Data Source with the scraped Real Estate Data from the website casaclick.it. I will focus on three cities from Italy (Florence, Turin and Venice) and use Selector Gadget (a chrome extension) on the website to scrape the Real Estate Listing by neighborhoods. The end goal for this project is to answer to the question: "If I were to buy a house in a certain neighborhood within the three cities, which one will profit me the most through Airbnb? (In other words, which one, if rented out with Airbnb, which neighborhood will more likely give me back the amount of money I spent on buying the house?)". 
We will scrape the first page of each neighborhoods for each city, then we will compare the neiborhoods with the Areas given in the Airbnb Data and answer to the question.
